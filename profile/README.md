# When you do not manage your own time, you become a slave.

***Discipline EQUALS freedom.*** LEAD. *Refuse to ever follow.* Stop caring what idiots think! Minimize your circle. Ditch victims, worriers, materialists. Refuse to ever associate with people governed by their fears. We LEAD by example; we work on the ventures, ideas and projects are within our control. Each month, throughout the year, we try to focus particularly on one area of our guru DISCIPLINE, but we use and try to strengthen each one of these areas of DISCIPLINE with every second of every day.

1) Your time is the ONLY asset you have in life. You get 86400 secs/day. Plan each year to become your own guru.

2) Never HATE, either yourself or others. Learn to FORGIVE without forgetting lessons learned from unpleasantness.

3) Pray without ceasing to synch your will to THE IDEAL. Focus with intent to OWN the DISCIPLINE of every second. 

4) Practically, we manage the tasks of our day with a time blocking methodology to predictably get our tasks done.

5) Your method for getting tasks becomes entirely your design, a method to try for starters is the 30 minute block.

6) 30 minutes is split into a 25 min MENTAL focus, 4 min focused PHYSICAL exercise Tabata and two 30 sec readjusts.

7) Plan with reverence; set aside one 30 min block to *sharpen the axe* or optimize each of the other time blocks.

8) Devote one entire 30 minute block each day to housekeeping or 5S-ing your work environment; set things in order.

9) Continuously experiment with your systems of organization and time mgmt approach. Cheat; use lifehacks of others.

10) Stop weakening the body; remove chairs, avoid most sitting; continuously strengthen your [musculoskeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system).

11) Minimalism is gratitude. Ditch all vulnerabilities causing worry. Give stuff away; don't be owned by your stuff.

12) As you go thru each day CONTINUOUS COMPOUND mental discipline; focus on the NOWNESS of improvement discipline.
