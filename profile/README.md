# When you do not manage your own time, you become a slave.

***Discipline EQUALS freedom.*** LEAD. *Refuse to ever follow or be influenced by celebrities.* Stop caring what the follower-types think ... LEAD!

Minimize your circle. Ditch victims, worriers, materialists. Refuse to ever associate with people governed by their fears. We LEAD by example; we work on the ventures, ideas and projects are within our control. Each month, throughout the year, we try to focus particularly on one area of our guru DISCIPLINE, but we use and try to strengthen each one of these areas of DISCIPLINE with every second of every day.

1) Time's the ONLY asset we have. You get 86400 secs/day, 30 or 31 days/month. Plan each month. Become your own guru.

2) Never HATE, either yourself or others. Learn to FORGIVE without forgetting lessons learned from unpleasantness.

3) Pray without ceasing. Synch your will to your Creator's. Focus with reverent intent to fully OWN the DISCIPLINE. 

4) Your method for setting goals, planning tasks becomes your day, your life. Return to basics, eg 30 min time-block.

5) 30 minutes is split into a 25 min MENTAL focus, 4 min focused PHYSICAL exercise Tabata and two 30 sec readjusts.

6) Plan with reverence; set aside one 30 min block to *sharpen the axe* or optimize each of the other time blocks.

7) Devote one entire 30 minute block each day to housekeeping or 5S-ing your work environment; set things in order.

8) Based on experience, optimize the time-blocking details to predictably develop plans, set agendas, get tasks done.

9) Always be flanking! Cheat! Steal lifehacks that work! Experiment with new systems of time mgmt and organization.

10) Stop weakening the body; remove chairs, avoid most sitting; continuously strengthen your [musculoskeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system).

11) Minimalism is gratitude. Ditch all vulnerabilities causing worry. Give stuff away; don't be owned by your stuff.

12) As you go thru each day CONTINUOUS COMPOUND mental discipline; focus on the NOWNESS of improvement discipline.
