# When do do not manage your own time, you become a slave.

***Discipline EQUALS freedom.***

Your time is the ONLY asset you have in this existence. You get 86400 seconds/day. Use each second to become your own guru.

As you go through the day CONTINUOUS COMPOUND the mental discipline by focusing on the NOWNESS of your time mgmt improvement.

Pray without ceasing to synch your will to THE IDEAL; improve the mental focus DISCIPLINE with each second. OWN every second. 

Practically, we usually cannot manage the tasks of our day by the second, so we pick a time blocking method to get tasks done.

Your time mgmt and method for getting tasks is entirely up to you, a time-blocking to try for starters is the 30 minute block.

Each 30 minutes can be split into a 25 minute MENTAL focus, a 4 minute focused PHYSICAL exercise Tabata with 30 second readjustments.

It is NECESSARY to set aside one entire 30 minute block to the task of planning the day to optimize the strategy for the other 47 daily blocks.

It is best to devote one entire 30 minute block each day to housekeeping and generally 5S-ing your work environment to set things in YOUR order.

Continuously experiment with your systems of organization and your time mgmt approach; set aside time to get ideas from life hackers.

How your body uses the day matters; remove chairs and avoid most sitting; continuously standing will strengthen your [musculoskeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system).

Never waste any energy on HATING yourself or others; learn how to FORGIVE without forgetting lessons learned from any unpleasant incidents.

Never waste energy WORRYING about things out of your control. Practice minimalism. Ditch any burden that causes worry, eg give stuff away.

LEAD. Refuse to ever follow. Do not waste time worrying about what others think. Minimize your circle. Ditch the victims, worriers, materialists.
